responses:

  utter_introduce_exhibit:
  - text: The Archaeological Museum of Thessaloniki houses the world's largest collection of gold wreaths from the classical and Hellenistic periods. The gold blossomed myrtle wreath on display is one of the most richly decorated wreaths to have survived from antiquity.

  utter_say_acquisition:
  - text: The golden wreath is the product of an illicit excavation and probably came from a tomb in Central Macedonia. It was traded illegally abroad and in 1993 was purchased by the Jean Paul Getty Museum of the USA. In 2007 after negotiations it was returned to Greece.

  utter_say_dating:
  - text: The wreath dates back to the end of the 4th century BC. Golden wreaths were especially widespread during 350-300 BC., when the economy of the Macedonian kingdom flourishes as a consequence of the conquests of Alexander the Great in the East. Initially, wreaths were lavishly and elaborately decorated, but from the beginning of the 3rd c. BC. the tendency for simpler constructions is documented.

  utter_say_creation:
  - text: The wreath consists of two tubular stems that were tightly tied with gold wire at the back of the head, while at the front they were joined with a double gold wire in the form of the so-called "Herculean knot", which refers to the knot  formed by lionskin of the hero. On the hoop are secured 26 stems with myrtle leaves and a total of 135 extremely natural-looking flowers of seven types.

  utter_say_material:
  - text: The wreath is entirely made of gold. Its unique aesthetic effect is achieved by the use of blue or green enamel on some petals, while the gold stamens are tipped with tiny gold or glass beads, tinted white or blue. In addition to gold wreaths, there were those made of silver, as well as gilded ones made of bronze, wood, and clay.

  utter_say_importance:
  - text: The golden myrtle wreath was the product of illicit excavation and trade. It is particularly important that after decades it was identified, claimed, and returned to our country with the necessary legal procedures.

  utter_say_use:
  - text: Gold wreaths belonged to rich and aristocratic families, which indicated their high social or economic status. They were worn at weddings, banquets, and other types of social events. They were also dedicated by the believers to sanctuaries, they were offered as competition prizes, while they also had a religious character.

  utter_say_burial:
  - text: The largest number of gold wreaths come from rich tombs, indicating the powerful social status of the deceased while alive. Wreaths accompanied the dead as a prize earned over their lifetime, like the crown awarded to an athlete who has been victorious in a contest. At the same time, they had an apotropaic use by protecting the deceased on their journey to the other world.
