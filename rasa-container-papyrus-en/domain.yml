responses:

  utter_introduce_exhibit:
  - text:  The Derveni Papyrus is considered the oldest book in Europe and is one of the most treasured exhibits of the Archaeological Museum of Thessaloniki.

  utter_say_content:
  - text: The papyrus contains the text of a book, of which neither the beginning nor the end survives. First, the author, a prophet or soothsayer, addresses candidates for initiation and describes devotional practices relating to the fate of the soul after death, while an Orphic hymn is developed afterward. This hymn accompanied the initiation rites for those to whom the book is addressed.

  utter_say_language:
  - text: The text is written in dark ink in capital letters and in the Attic dialect, with certain Ionian elements.

  utter_say_creation:
  - text: The manuscript itself dates from between 340 and 320 BC, but was copied from a much older work, thought to have been at least a century older dated to around 420-410 BC.

  utter_say_exposition:
  - text: This unique find was exhibited for the first time at the Archaeological Museum of Thessaloniki in 1962. Since 2013, the papyrus has been hosted in the permanent exhibition The Gold of Macedon, placed in a horizontal showcase with special humidity and temperature conditions for its proper preservation.

  utter_say_size:
  - text: The part of the papyrus that is preserved and exhibited in the Museum is 9.4 centimeters high and constitutes the upper part of a cylinder that had a total length of about 3 meters.

  utter_say_finding:
  - text: The papyrus was found in a cist grave in January 1962 during the excavation conducted by Petros Themelis at the cemetery of ancient Leti, in Derveni, Thessaloniki. According to his words, it resembled a burnt newspaper. The Greek climate does not allow for the preservation of papyri. However, in the case of Derveni, the papyrus survived only because it was partially charred since it was found amid the remains of the funeral pyre.

  utter_say_importance:
  - text: It is the oldest book in Europe and was the first Greek entry in the UNESCO International "Memory of the World” register in October 2015.

  utter_say_writer:
  - text: Many hypotheses have been proposed about the author of the book, whose identity remains unknown. One of them identifies the author with a prophet and theologian, Euthyphron from Prospalta of Attica.

  utter_say_making:
  - text: Papyrus comes from the processing of the Cyperus Papyrus plant that grows in the marshes of the Nile Delta. For its manufacture, the plant was cut into thin strips. These were placed on a hard and wet surface laid side by side, and on top of them, the second set of strips followed placed at right angles atop the first set. A wide-surfaced hammer was used to bond the two layers and then the sheet was dried in the sun.
