responses:

  utter_introduce_exhibit:
  - text: The famous bronze krater is one of the most important finds of the Derveni cemetery. This unique masterpiece is preserved entirely and is exhibited at the Archaeological Museum of Thessaloniki.
  
  utter_say_making:
  - text: The vessel is made of two hammered bronze plates, one for the body and one for the upper part of the neck. Conversely, the vessel's spiral handles and base, as well as the statuettes on its shoulder are cast, bearing added hammered decorative elements.

  utter_say_belonging:
  - text: An inscription on the rim of the vase is inscribed in silver letters. It is written in the Thessalian dialect and states "I am the krater of Astion the son of Anaxagoras from Larissa". Whether this Astion was the occupant of the tomb or a previous owner of the krater is a question that remains unanswered. 

  utter_say_creation:
  - text: The krater dates back to 330-320 BC. and was probably manufactured in a Macedonian workshop. It seems that the artist, who probably came from an Ionian city in Chalcidice, had been well acquainted with Attic art styles and was probably apprenticed in Athens.

  utter_say_depiction:
  - text: On the main face of the krater, the sacred marriage of the god Dionysus with Ariadne is depicted, with the naked god resting his leg on his wife's thigh, in an erotic gesture.

  utter_say_material:
  - text: Although the krater seems to be made of gold, it is not. It is made of bronze, i.e. an alloy of copper and tin. Its lovely golden colour is due to the alloyâ€™s very high tin content. Many of the bronze vessels from the Derveni tombs have the same golden color.

  utter_say_importance:
  - text: The Derveni Krater is a masterpiece of unparalleled craftsmanship. It stands 90 cm tall and weighs 40 kilos. It is the largest metal vase from Classical Antiquity that bears relief decoration on its entire surface.

  utter_say_use:
  - text: The krater belongs to the vessels used at banquets for mixing wine with water. However, it appears that the vessel was never used at banquets, but only as an urn. In particular, it contained the cremated remains of a man and a young woman, who were accompanied by valuable offerings.

  utter_say_burial:
  - text: The use of the krater as a cremation urn is linked to expectations of continued revelry in the other world.  At the same time, the choice of a Dionysian scene for its decoration alludes to the rebirth that Dionysus offers his followers, expressing the desire and hope for the immortality of the soul.

  -utter_say_finding:
  - text: The krater was found in 1962 during the excavation of the cist grave B' in Derveni, Thessaloniki. It is the richest tomb out of the seven found in total in Derveni. It contained gold jewellery, vessels made of silver, bronze, glass, alabaster and clay, weapons, and metal wreaths
